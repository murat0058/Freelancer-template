# ASP.NET MVC version of [Freelancer Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

This is an ASP.NET MVC 5.0 solution for StartBootstrap's Freelancer Template.

In this version, you'll find a CMS panel to edit the site's content.

## Document based data store

All the content are stored as JSON in the "data/data.txt" file.
You don't need any database.

## Update Initials

The initial Admin username and password are: 
username: admin 
password: admin 
To change them, you have to edit their values in the web.config file! 
To get the hashed password, you'll have to go to /Admin/GeneratePassword and get the hashed value.

The "Localfilespath" key in the Web.Config should be changed to you folder's location as well as the "MyEmail" key where you'll have to put your own email.

Finally, you'll need to give permission to the "data" and "images" folder.
